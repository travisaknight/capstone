Exercise.create!(name: "Pull-ups", category_id: 1, video_url: "http://www.youtube.com/embed/3Eq4VF5SudM", description: "The pull-up is a closed-chain movement where the body is suspended by the hands and pulls up. As this happens, the elbows flex and the shoulders adduct and extend to bring the elbows to the torso.")
Exercise.create!(name: "Lunges", category_id: 2, video_url: "http://www.youtube.com/embed/-P9HIPp1QG4", description: "A lunge can refer to any position of the human body where one leg is positioned forward with knee bent and foot flat on the ground while the other leg is positioned behind. It is used by athletes in cross-training for sports, by weight-trainers as a fitness exercise, and by yogis as part of an asana regimen.")
Exercise.create!(name: "Deadlift", category_id: 2, video_url: "http://www.youtube.com/embed/T7-p5RBADIY", description: "Deadlift refers to the lifting of dead weight (weight without momentum), such as weights lying on the ground. It is one of the few standard weight training exercises in which all repetitions begin with dead weight. There are several positions one can approach when performing the deadlift, which include the conventional deadlift, squat, and sumo-deadlift. In most other lifts there is an eccentric (lowering of the weight) phase followed by the concentric (lifting of the weight) phase. During these exercises, a small amount of energy is stored in the stretched muscles and tendons in the eccentric phase if the lifter is not flexible beyond the range of motion. Although this exercise uses the hips and legs as the primary movers, it can just as easily be considered a back exercise.")

It can be performed in a movement prep protocol, or as a core accessory to improve strength and muscular endurance.")
